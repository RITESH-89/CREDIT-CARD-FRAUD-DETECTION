🔍 Project Flow (Frontend Only)
User opens the form in a browser.

Inputs required data: card number, transaction info, location, merchant details.

On submission, the form validates input fields client-side.

If connected to a backend (/detect), it would then send the data for real-time fraud detection.

🧠 Possible Enhancements
Integrate a real backend using Flask or Node.js to process detection

Use a pre-trained ML model from build_model.ipynb

Add visual fraud probability indicators

Store and display transaction history using localStorage or database
